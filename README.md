# Design-and-fabrication-of-low-power-5V-SMPS
Design and fabrication of a low-power 5V SMPS using KiCad involves schematic design, PCB layout, and testing. The SMPS provides efficient, regulated 5V output for low-power electronic applications.
This project focuses on the design and fabrication of a low-power 5 V Switched Mode Power Supply (SMPS) intended for efficient and compact DC power applications. The SMPS was designed using KiCad software, where the complete schematic capture and PCB layout were developed. The design typically includes an input rectification stage, high-frequency switching element, transformer or inductor, fast recovery/output rectifier, LC filtering, and a feedback control circuit to regulate the output voltage at 5 V. Emphasis was placed on component selection to minimize power loss, improve efficiency, and ensure stable operation under varying load conditions.

Using KiCad, the schematic was converted into a two-layer PCB layout with proper grounding, short high-current paths, and adequate isolation between high-voltage and low-voltage sections. After verification through ERC and DRC checks, the PCB was fabricated and assembled. The fabricated SMPS was tested for output voltage regulation, ripple, and efficiency, demonstrating reliable 5 V output suitable for low-power electronics such as microcontrollers, sensors, and embedded systems.
